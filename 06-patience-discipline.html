        <h1>The Hardest Part of Algorithmic Trading: Doing Nothing</h1>

        <p>I've been running a mean reversion paper trading system for a few days now. It's designed to look for specific conditions: price at the lower Bollinger Band, RSI below 30, and moderate volatility (not too high, not too low).</p>

        <p>So far, it has executed exactly zero trades.</p>

        <h2>Why Zero Trades Is Not Zero Progress</h2>

        <p>When I first saw this, my instinct was to loosen the parameters. "Maybe the thresholds are too strict?" But then I looked at what it was seeing:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>BTC volatility: 91st percentile (way too high)</li>
            <li>RSI: 40-45 range (not oversold)</li>
            <li>Price position: Middle of Bollinger Bands (not at extremes)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The system wasn't broken. The market just wasn't offering the conditions I was looking for.</p>

        <h2>The Discipline of Selectivity</h2>

        <p>This is where algorithmic trading teaches something profound: <strong>the discipline to do nothing when conditions aren't right is itself valuable</strong>.</p>

        <p>A human trader might feel pressure to "do something" after watching the market for hours. They might convince themselves a mediocre setup is actually good. They might trade out of boredom or FOMO.</p>

        <p>The algorithm just... waits.</p>

        <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>High selectivity is a feature, not a bug</strong> - If my strategy only triggers 20-50 times per week on average, and we're in a particularly volatile week, zero trades this week is completely reasonable.</li>

            <li><strong>Volatility isn't always opportunity</strong> - When ATR is in the 90th+ percentile, that often signals chaotic conditions where mean reversion doesn't work reliably. Staying out is the right call.</li>

            <li><strong>Patience compounds</strong> - Every bad trade I don't take preserves capital for the good ones. In a £200 account, this matters enormously.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Real Test</h2>

        <p>The real test of a trading system isn't how it performs when conditions are perfect. It's whether it has the discipline to sit on its hands when they're not.</p>

        <p>So far: passing.</p>
